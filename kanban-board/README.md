# Kanban Board API

This folder contains client and server implementations for a Kanban Board API. These implementations add hypermedia to [the "REST" version of the same API](https://github.com/dillonredding/kanban-board-rest-api). Check out the [API Evolvability with Siren](https://dillonredding.github.io/2023/07/14/api-evolvability-with-siren.html) blog post for an in-depth explanation.

See the client and server READMEs in the corresponding folders for instructions on how to run them locally.
